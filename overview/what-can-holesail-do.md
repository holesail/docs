**Holesail tip:** We are the only product of our kind that offers both the easiest way to connect and extraordinary security.
{% endhint %}

Holesail is a Swiss-knife **network tunnelling** and **reverses proxy** that does more than I can list out here:

1. Access your machines over the internet; no port forwarding or static IP is required.
2. Share locally running servers, websites and AI with anyone.
3. Share files and folders remotely. There are no bandwidth restrictions and no size limits.
4. Play Minecraft and any LAN game remotely with your friends.
5. Secure your SSH servers, block IP access and access securely with Holesail.
