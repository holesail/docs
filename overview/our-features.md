## Built with security in Mind

Holesail is not only a tunnelling software but also a security tool. All data that goes through holesail is encrypted and never touches any third-party server ever.&#x20;

All connections are completely peer-to-peer, and only the person with whom you share your "connection key" can find you and connect with you.

This gives you both ease of connection and security against any third-party

## Truly Peer-to-Peer

**Holesail is the only truly peer-to-peer software** of its kin&#x64;**;** there are **no servers** or third party relays. You own all your data and only the person you share access with can find you and connect to you.

Other peers in the network have no idea what you are running, if it is running, or how to connect to it or even if you are using holesail.

## It's Open Source

Holesail and all of its modules are completely open source. This gives third-party services a method to  integrate holesail into their system and make their services secure and easy to connect to.
