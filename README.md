## Overview

Holesail allows you to connect to any service running on your machines over the internet, with no servers, no centralisation, no static IP, and no port forwarding.

> It’s Tailscale but without servers, no accounts, and no complicated setup. Just scan the QR, and you’re connected, encrypted, fast, and easy.&#x20;

> I’ve become a Holesail addict. If I can’t just generate a key and connect remotely to my service now, I’m now just looking for a replacement that does let me do this. I don’t even try anymore. It’s either as easy as Holesail, or I’ll find a replacement 🤣

> Just used @holesail\_io to connect to a service running on Linux localhost on my MacBook. I can use it easily and from anywhere.&#x20;

> Even via Terminal, this is the easiest and quickest way I've ever connected two computers and shared a service/app. Generate key, paste key, done.

> Holesail allows us to provide a revolutionary Peer-to-Peer (P2P) tunnelling solution, giving users instant access to their local networks without the need for complex configurations. This innovative approach ensures seamless connectivity and robust security through end-to-end encryption.\
